# Intuition
Save values into a set and if we hit a number previously seen return it. 

# Approach
Create an empty set, add new elements into the set, and if an element is already present in the list, return it.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$ as we traverse over the whole list unless a duplicate is found. 

- Space complexity: $O(n)$ as we save each unique element into a set. 

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        vals = set()
        for n in nums:
            if n in vals:
                return True
            else:
                vals.add(n)
        return False
```
