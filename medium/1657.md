# Determine if two strings are close
--- 
# Intuition
Op1 allows us to freely reorder the string by swapping any selected two letters. Op2 allows us to swap frequencies of letters with one another freely. With these two operations, we only need to ensure that the letters in both strings contain the same letters and the same number of frequencies per letter. 

# Approach
Create a dictionary for each word, and check if the letters and the frequencies are the same and allow us to turn one string into another with given operations. Could be made more efficient with Counter from collections but I found the code below to be easier to understand. 

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) since we traverse both lists once. 

- Space complexity: O(1) since at most we will have 26 items in the dictionaries. 

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False

        w1, w2 = defaultdict(int), defaultdict(int)
        for c in word1:
            w1[c] += 1
        for c in word2:
            w2[c] += 1

        letts = set(w1.keys())   == set(w2.keys())
        freqs = sorted(w1.values()) == sorted(w2.values())
        
        return freqs and letts
